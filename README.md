# Concurrent-Cars
+ Practice Concurrency concepts in Java. This project aims to create a system where concurrent users can access cars and control them

# Design
## User
## Car
## Main

# Concepts Learnt:
+ Implements Runnable --> Add to class definition to include concurrent functionality.
+ Adding a run() function to my class that will be running concurrently. Parameters must be empty.
+ Adding synchronized to the function signature ensures the function accessing resources mutually exclusively.
